# Mini Chat
This is currently a basic implementation for the encrypted chatting system, where clients can only connect to server via tcp. For specific please refer to `server` folder.  
I am turning the whole project to `gin` + `websocket`. More functions are in development and will soon apply.

# TO DO
1. Intergration for user registeration and login part
2. Update with group info
3. Frontend UI
4. Upload file(picture, video less than 5M, etc) in chat room
